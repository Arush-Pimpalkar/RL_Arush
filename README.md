# Deep Loop Shaping for Pendulum Control

Replicating results from **"Improving Cosmological Reach of a Gravitational Wave Observatory using Deep Loop Shaping"** applied to a single pendulum system.

## Overview

This project uses deep reinforcement learning to control a pendulum, following methods from gravitational wave detector research. The pendulum is simulated with MuJoCo.
