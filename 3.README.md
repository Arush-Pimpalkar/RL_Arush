# Replicating Deepmind Result

## Overview
Attempting to replicate the MPO agent with frequency based rewards and comparing with a simple MPO with a time based reward. Integrated ground based noise from zenodo. 


### Frequency-Band MPO 
```python
# 1. Extract 3 frequency bands from pitch error signal
#    - Low: < 3 Hz
#    - Mid: 8-30 Hz (observation band)
#    - High: > 40 Hz

# 2. Compute power in each band (via FFT)

# 3. Apply sigmoid scoring (lower power = higher score)

# 4. Combined reward = low_score × mid_score × high_score
```

Right: Fig 1B from [DeepMind Paper](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adw1291)

Pitch Angle RMS: 4.127e-10 rad =   0.4127 nrad 
Strain Sensitivity RMS: 1.032e-19    


### Why is the Strain Sensitivty is so smooth?
The projected strain ASD is smooth because the simplified pitch plant used here does not include the full multi stage suspension dynamics present in the LIGO. We trained the MPO using transfer functions and included just sesimic noise in our models.

## Mirror Pitch ASD
This plot shows the pitch ASD - the Measured plot includes the sensor noise.

## Noise Plots
I have included sesimic noise and sensor noise. The fig below shows their time domain strain and ASDs.
