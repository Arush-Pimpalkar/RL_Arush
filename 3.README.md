# Replicating Deepmind Result

## Overview
Attempting to replicate the MPO agent with frequency based rewards and comparing with a simple MPO with a time based reward. Integrated ground based noise from zenodo. 


### Frequency-Band MPO 
```python
# 1. Extract 3 frequency bands from pitch error signal
#    - Low: < 3 Hz
#    - Mid: 8-30 Hz (observation band)
#    - High: > 40 Hz

# 2. Compute power in each band (via FFT)

# 3. Apply sigmoid scoring (lower power = higher score)

# 4. Combined reward = low_score × mid_score × high_score
```

Strain Sensitivity RMS: 1.032e-19    

Pitch Angle RMS: 4.127e-10 rad =   0.4127 nrad
