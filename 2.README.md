# Reward Function Explanation

![Base Reward Function](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Arush-Pimpalkar/RL_Arush/main/plots/base_reward_function.png)


The angle term ($\theta$) is assigned unit weight to define the primary regulation objective. The angular velocity term ($\dot{\theta}$) is downweighted to account for its larger numerical scale and to provide appropriate damping, consistent with the pendulum’s natural frequency. The control penalty ($u$) is chosen several orders of magnitude smaller to regularize the policy without inhibiting stabilization, matching the torque scale required to counteract gravity. Together, these weights approximate a quadratic energy-based cost, closely related to LQR and classical damping design, ensuring physically meaningful and stable behavior.


## Reward Function with High-Frequency Penalty

The reward function used in this model:

- $\lambda_{\text{penalty}}$: Weight controlling the contribution of the high-frequency penalty.
- $\text{hf\_score}$: Energy contained in the high-frequency ($f > 10$) components of the control signal.
